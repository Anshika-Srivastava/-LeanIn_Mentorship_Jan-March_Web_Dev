## Milestone 4 :
As a part of our fourth milestone, we had to create a multipage application using react router. Here I have created a blog site where you can post and read your blogs. </br>
React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL. </br>

* This is how the home page looks:

* This is how we can post a blog:

</br>

* The about section tells about the app and also mentions the steps for starting with it:
